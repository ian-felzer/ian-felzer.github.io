            <p>Technology is a growing part of our everyday lives. From applications on our phones to the digitization of many of our daily functions, it is impossible to avoid the impacts, both positive and negative that this increase in technology creates. Over the past decades both science fiction and reality have imagined a future in which technology is onmipresent in our cities. From transportation to communication and governance, it has been imagined and planned that technology will bring forth a new future in which life is simpler, more convienent, and requires less human activity to maintain and manage. Over the past few years especially we have seen the unstoppable growth of technology companies around the world, which has allowed them to gain power and capital that has rarely been seen before in human history. This power among other things requires that companies maintain and expand the status quo, both by limiting competitors and by working closely with governments to make sure that they have the tools and support needed to maintain their power.

            <p> Smart city projects are being researched and developed in cities around the world including in Estonia, Montreal, Amsterdam, Barcelona, and even New York City.  Each city is approaching common problems and challenges differently, with some focusing on implementing new technology in as many parts of urban life as possible, while others are focusing on making cities and governments work better for the people, with technology working as one tool in that effort. As Susan Leigh Star describes in her article entitled “The Ethnography of Infrastructure”, <blockquote> “People commonly envision infrastructure as a system of substrates-railroad lines, pipes and plumbing, electrical power plants, and wires. It is by definition invisible, part of the background for other kinds of work” (380).</blockquote><br> As Star describes, infrastructure is not just the physical elements that make up our urban world, but also the systems and connections between people and society that are often invisible, until they become broken and force change to be considered. These systems are closely linked to politics, sociocultural systems, and economics, and reflect the histories and themes that have guided our modern building of cities of scale. That is why it is both essential to understand the histories of the infrastructure that we take part in each day, and to understand who benefits from the current system and who is harmed by it. The systems that are examined in this project reflect a future in which it is both expected and mandatory for users to be ingrained with digital society. For this technology to work, citizens must have phones,computers, or other devices, or risk being shut out from the government services and support that many rely on globally. Citizens must also accept the reality that they are all part of a large test study in which data is being collected about how they use government services, how they interact with the world, and how they live their lives. While this data may be anonymous or non-personal, it is still data that reflects how we live our lives, and is therefore inherently as personal as it can be. The study of STS focuses on how humanity interacts with science, culture, and technology, and how these topics interact on a daily basis. The study of infrastructure I beleive best encompasses the work of STS, because it studies how we interact with the world, and how the systems built into our society respond to the needs and goals of populations. </p>

                <h2 class="header"><a href="#">Google Sidewalk Labs Toronto</a></h2>

                <p> In 2017 Sidewalk Labs, a subsidary company owned by Google announced a deal with the city of Toronto to develop 12 acres of waterfront property into a technologically advanced model for its city of the future. The plan had the potential to encorporate its plans across over 800 acres of land in Toronto's Port Lands. Sidewalk Labs worked with Waterfront Tornto, a city agency to plan, design, and coordinate the project which was projected to cost over $1 Billion funded almost entirely by the Google Subsidiary itself (Hawkins). <br> The project was planned in phases, with each phase allowing for the company to move its footprint deeper into the Toronto Metro area, including in the neighboring area of Quayside. Among the benefits that Sidewalk Labs sought to receive in exchange for completing this technological project would be a share of the property taxes and development fees associated with this land, as well as the oppurtinity to obtain more valuable land in the process(“Google’s Sidewalk Labs Plans Massive Expansion to Waterfront Vision | The Star”).<br> </p>

                <p> Among the technological systems that Sidewalk Labs sought to install in the city included sensors to monitor vehicle and pedestrians to improve crosswalk safety, heated pavements, public wifi, advanced power grids, and many other sensor based technologies, that although were promised to collect only anonymized data or personally identifiable information (PII) with the approval of the owner, concerns about data collection, management, and sharing were among the reasons why the project was ultimately abandoned in May of 2020.  </p>

                <p>This project displayed the limits of local government institutions, and caused many local Canadians to develop distrust in the systems of government that allowed the project to move forward with limited oversight and protections.</p>

                    <p> As a subsidiary of one of the world's largest and most technologically advanced companies, Sidewalk Labs was able to convince members of the Toronto government, both through data and likely through promised revenue, that using advanced sensors and artificial  intelligence in almost every aspect of urban life from parking management, to power meters to waste management and everything in between. Although many promises were made by the company, including to make cities more affordable, safer,and innovative, while having the convenient byproduct of producing endless amounts of data about how people travel, live, communicate, and interact with their surroundings. </p>

                <h3 class="header"> Ethics of Project</h3>


                <p>Technology ethicist and researcher Bianca Wylie covered this project across many of its stages and through her work she in part described Sidewalk Lab's goal as to increase its power and to act as in effect a fourth arm of the Canadian government in its aim of expanding its reach as far as possible in the public works sector.<br> While the public received some opportunity to voice their concerns about the project, much of the information provided by Sidewalk Labs and the Canadian government was simply marketing materials meant to display the positive aims of the project, rather than details about how it planned to use, collect, and safeguard public data. <br> <br> As Wylie explains,since Waterfront Toronto, the real estate company co-leading this project was not beholden to Canadian freedom of information legislation, most of the negotiations for this project took place, and remained behind closed doors despite the strong impact on the public that any decisions would hold (Wiley, 2020) When seeking out potential companies to take on this public works initiative, Waterfront Tornto asked the respondents to create both the technological systems that would power the new city, and the government and legal frameworks that would govern the use, collection, and reporting requirements for data collection and finances (Wylie, 2020). As Wylie states, "Part of what made Sidewalk Toronto so problematic, from a governance perspective, was the power it threatened to hand over to Sidewalk Labs to lay out the infrastructure design of a large swathe of public and private space" Wylie,2020). This is the issue at the core of this project. <br><br> While Sidewalk Labs created a plan to use a Data Trust to manage urban data and create a transparent process for approving the use or collection of data, as researchers form the University of Toronto describe, data trusts are not legal systems but rather a construct used to refer to any system in which data is handled with trust, and not legally bound by any specific terms. Thee researchers concluded that this project in particular presented conflicting models for how data would be managed, by both promising that data would be de-identified by default, but that it would also be publicly accessible, which goes against the idea of public ownership of data, rather than corporate control of it (Austin, 2021). Among the other problems with its data usage included the fact that since the proposed data trust would be a non-profit corporation, it would not be subject to Canada's federal private sector data protection laws or provincial public sector data laws, and thereby largely avoiding legal oversight (Austin, 2021). </p>

                <p>Ultimately what brought the project to its ultimate demise was a combination of public pressure, financial challenges, and incomplete planning that motivated the company and the city not to move forward with the project. While Sidewalk Labs as a company still exists and produces technology for cities, it has not achieved its goal of obtaining hundreds of acres of public land for use as a digital model for its ideal future society. This project shows what happens when governments allow companies to experiment with new technologies on a scale that impacts hundreds of thousands or even millions of people without regulation or significant oversight. While some of the plans in this project may have significantly improved the quality of life for citizens of the area, when presented with list of hundreds of unique and technologically complex features, citizens should not be expected to determine for themselves what risks each poses to their personal and digital safety, and which are violations of their privacy or rights under Canadian law. <br> <br> As part of this project Sidewalk Labs would have become a quasi public agency with potentially infinite amounts of information on the lives of private citizens. While the potential for technology to be used in beneficial ways such as to make streets safer and to reduce energy costs is a valuable prospect to consider, as Wylie states, turning over this much power to a private company who is given largely free reign to construct the city as they wish, is a dangerous and irreversible decision that can cost people their privacy and create even greater monopolies of scale (Wylie). </p> <br><br>

                <p> A study from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace found that 56 of 176 countries involved in creating new 'smart cities' actively use artificial intelligence for surveillance purposes as part of smart city or “safe city” initiatives (Wilkinson). While Sidewalk Labs promised to de-identify or otherwise protect the anonymity and privacy of data,high level data about how people use and interact with their surroundings and environment such as in the case of Sidewalk Lab's plans to make street safer using sensors and real time environmental monitors can still be used both financially and technologically to build and sell future technologies built using data obtained through users who were unaware of the data being collected or how it would be used. </p>

                <h3 class="header">Singapore</h3>

                <p> In 2014 Singapore launched the Smart Nation initiative in order to 'support better living, stronger communites, and create more oppurtunities for all" ("Singapore's Smart Nation Initiative- A Policy and Organizational Perspective"). The country has said that it is basing the platform off of Estonia's Digital identification system, which is expansive in terms of capabilities across both public and private sector organizations (Lago). Forming the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) the Government sought to bring in a new digital transformation of Singapore across the main areas of transport, urban living, businesses, health, digital government services, and strategic national projects. The government invested over $2.4 billion in fiscal year 2017 into technologies such as data analytics, sensors and related software that would allow for data to be shared between data centers and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors across Singapore ("Smart Nation and Digital Government Group, 2017"). (<br><br> In 2003 Singapore launched SingPass, or the Singapore Personal Access, a system used to connect Singapore residents to hundreds of e-services provided by over 60 government agencies. Among the promises made by the Government as to the benefits of this technology are its increased security provided by Two-Factor technology, which takes the form of either a one-time login pin, or more advanced features such as the newly launched facial recognition feature ("Singpass, 2020"). In 2018 the mobile app for SingPass was launched which allows user to access over 1,400 services across public and private sectors ("Digital Identity in Response to COVID-19"). Over 4 million Singapore residents currently use the app, and users often visit the app multiple times a month, making it a valuable tool for performing functions such as signing documents, authorizing transactions, and interact with both business and government organizations ("Digital Identity in Response to COVID-19"). <br><br> When COVID-19 first became a problem in Singapore, the country launched TraceTogether, a platform designed for COVID-19 contact tracing and quarantine enforcement. Currently, over 80% of the Singaporian population uses the app, with the government mandating that residents  seeking to enter certain venues and events either use the mobile application or a physical fob that performs the same function. The app works by using Bluetooth to determine if two users are in close proximity, and using encrypted user IDs to communicate with the users should one test positive for COVID-19 (Han). While the government promised that this data would only be used for contact tracing and in the case of severe criminal investigations, there were multiple points in the launch of this service in which the government failed to fully communicate who would be able to use or access the data ((“In TraceTogether We Trust: Singapore’s Challenge with Data Governance and Ethics | Singapore Policy Journal”). As one of the first countries to implement a national contact tracing solution, many faulted the government for not being more upfront about any and all potential use cases for the data. 
                    <br><br> 
                    The Singapore Digital Government Blueprint outlines the government's hopes for a largely digitized government by 2023 ("Digital Government Blueprint"). Among the hopes for the plan is to provide users with a easy to use digital platform that will use artificial intelligence to provide personalized and anticipatory services to residents and business owners. The country has launched a number of systems in hopes of reaching this goal including OpenCerts, a blockchain based platform used to issue and validate academic certificates in order to prevent tampering or fraud ("Digital Government Blueprint"). The government has also began using robotics and other artificial intelligence based technologies to try to enhance safety, efficiency, and functionality, including through the creation of the Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP), a system used to coordinate and connect thousands of digital sensors that can feed into data platforms. As part of this plan the country aims to replace all 110,000 lamp posts in Singapore with wireless sensors that could allow for wireless beacons to be installed in each post that could guide electric vehicles or assist with road management and functionality (Bhunia). The plan also includes a strategy to develop a video analytics platform which could study traffic patterns, detect problems with roads, and would consist of feeds from public cameras installed along streets. Among the features that are being tested in these systems are facial recognition capabilities supported by the cameras mounted in the lamp posts, something that a government spokesperson confirmed to Reuters in 2018 (Geddie).

                <h3 class="header">Ethics </h3>

                <p>These platforms currently in use by Singapore, and those currently in testing or phased releases are worrying, and possess many similarities to technologies used in countries such as China to crack down on freedom of speech and government criticism (Dou). Yitu, a Chinese company claims that its facial recognition platform is capable of identifying over 1.9 billion faces in less than 3 seconds, something that would seemingly be easier to do in Singapore where the population is 5.68 million as of 2020 (Geddie). Singapore's SingPass presents a number of technological, social, and cultural issues that put the privacy and data of users at risk. Similar to the technology used in Estonia, many of the transactional services offered on the app are performed using cryptographic technologies, although details of the technology being used has not been revealed. In 2014 over 1,500 SingPass users had their accounts breached prior to the option of adding two factor authentication being created, although the extent to which the hackers gained access is  (Yu). In 2019 it was found that the Information Technology (IT) protocols in numerous Singapore government agencies were weak, including in the Defence Ministry and the Ministry of Finance. The problems found included weak measures to log any unauthorized users, and high levels of access that IT vendors had to information that they were not in a position to know (Yu).  </p>

                <h3 class="header"><a href="#estonia">Estonia</a></h3>

                <p> Estonia, starting in 2001 sought to revolutionize its country and create one of the most technologically advanced national government systems anywhere in the world. Using a three part system consisting of a digital identification system, a data exchange layer, and a application layer which allows different government and private servers to interact with the data exchange layer, the country has created a system in which common government tasks can be done entirely online (“Estonia X-Road Open Digital Ecosystem (ODE) Case Study”). Over 1,000 public and private organizations use the system, and its components are made to be reusable and to ensure privacy by design. Among the promises made by the government regarding the privacy of the system include that minimal data will be collected, that data will be collected no more than once when required, an that encryption and monitoring will be used to allow citizens to see when their data is accessed ("Estonia X-Road Case Study"). The exception to this rule is when a warrant is issued by a judge in order to gain access to a user's data. <br> <br> E-governance is defined as a way to improve the function of government through the use of online services or systems that allow for information to be exchanged in secure and simplified ways (Jahankhani et al.). E-government, including that designed by Estonia seeks to connect businesses, government, citizens, and employees through the uses of standard Web 2.0 platforms such as digital interfaces and server based communication, and as of more recently, Web 3.0 technologies such as Blockchain technologies. Prior to the implementation of their digital system of governance, around 70% of the Estonian population had never used the internet, and many had limited access to computers and a internet connection (Jahankhani et al.). In 2002 Estonia launched an electronic identification card which became mandatory for all citizens, which contains a electronic chip which can be read by any card reader or at a government kiosk. Estonia has also expanded its e-government feature to visitors, creating a electronic residency program that allows visitors to use Estonian public and private services such as business registration, banking services, and goods trading (Jahankani et al.). Estonia's goal is to have over 10 million e-residents by 2025, which is roughly 8 times its current population as of writing.<br> <br>  </p>


                <div id="estonia2">
                    <p>On top of these digital services for residents and corporations, Estonia created the X-Road, a Data Exchange Layer (DXL) that allows data to be safely exchanged between computer systems in both public and private institutions. This layer sits in between the digital identification and public access applications available to residents, and uses a system built off of blockchain technology to handle client authentication, data entry, secure data exchange, logging and monitoring. This technology has been expanded to several other countries including Finland, Namibia, Iceland and Ukraine (Jahankani et al). The final layer, the application layer, handles services for citizens such as e-business registry, access to police system, internet voting, education, social services, and healthcare access (estonia.gov). <br> <br> These systems are also being used to expand digital activities inside of Estonia including by connecting autonomous vehicles, freight transport, and other systems to this digital platform in order to increase the speed of border entries and transit within the country (estonia.gov).

                <p>This system uses a early implementation of blockchain technology to remove the need for a trusted third-party in the digital system. Estonia has been expanding this technology over many years, and has turned its country from a less technologically knowledgeable one, into one that offers many of its government services solely or largely on internet platforms. While a blockchain based system provides more security for the transfer and monitoring of data access, this system relies on critical trust between the government and the population, and the population must be able to have full access and knowledge as to the whereabouts of their data and personally identifiable information. As one of the first nations to attempt a digital transformation, Estonia has had to learn how to appropriately respond to cyber attacks that could cripple its digital infrastructure, something that Havard researcher Wolfgang Drechsler states makes the country both a beta tester for this new technology and a country that often experiences external hype driven by those who view the future as being technology driven and motivated (Drechsler). <br> While having digital services available to a population has many time and cost saving benefits, it makes it more difficult for outsiders and citizens to monitor the government's actions, and as we have seen with other uses of Blockchain technologies, it can ultimately be used to hide digital transactions or to gain entry into digital data systems. <br> <br> While blockchain is potentially a technology that can be valuable in improving accountability, as Professor and President of The Australian Association for Professional & Applied Ethics Simon Longstaff, describes, "The greater problem arises in conditions of asymmetry of power (bargaining power, information, kinetic force, etc.) – where blockchain might enable ‘transactions’ that are the product of force, fear and fraud" (Longstaff). This quote, although not directly associated with the E-Estonia project, displays the problem with any technology when used across a diverse population with varied levels of trust or experience with technology. While blockchain technology may speed up everyday government processes, without strong and reliable systems in place prior to digitization, these online services are likely to fail or not live up to expectations. <br><br> Whenever a government is in charge of creating, managing, and assuring the success of a platform as broad and far reaching as this one, there are always ethical concerns present about who has access to the technology behind it, and what if any backdoors are present. In 2007 Estonia was hit with a major cyber attack in the form of a Distributed Denial of Service (D-DoS) attack that brought its internet to a halt (Hague). While this attack did not compromise personal data, in the years since the internet has only become a greater element guiding every aspect of the personal and professional life of Estonians. The Estonian government may promise that the security measures of their system are virtually impenetrable, blockchain technologies are relatively new, and therefore it is likely that there are security me</p>

            <h3 class="header">Ethical and STS Considerations</h3>

            <p>Langdon Winner in his essay "Do Artifacts Have Politics" describes the overt less overt impacts of technology on city design stating, <blockquote>"if 
                our moral and political language for evaluating technology includes only categories having to do with tools and uses, if it does not include attention to the 
                meaning of the designs and arrangements of our artifacts, then we will be 
                blinded to much that is intellectually and practically crucial" (125).</blockquote> 
            
            While this quote focuses on the work of architect Robert Moses on the physical infrastructure that makes up New York City, the same principles and considerations must be adopted in our consideration of digital technologies.<br><br> 
        
            STS scholar Laura Forlano in her essay "Decentering the Human in the Design of Collaborative Cities" summarizes the issues with the technologies referenced in the above sections, stating in her essay 
            
            <blockquote>
                "Rather than being understood as political in themselves,
                decisions around these technological black boxes take place in
                bureaucratic black boxes: city agencies with endless acronyms and
                responsibility for technology and telecommunications issues (3)".</blockquote>
            
            In each of the examples, although especially in the example of Google's Sidewalk Lab, the government may have approved the project, but the public was left largely without any useful information from which to guide their opinions, and they had few options to fight back against the efforts of the government even if they wished. Without fully understanding the technology, residents were given seemingly two options, take part in this new technological testbed, or leave. As Paul Dourish and Genevieve Bell discuss in their article "Resistance is futile: reading science fiction alongside ubiquitous computing", among the questions raised by science fiction television shows are those regarding surveillance, both by state sponsored actors and private companies doing the bidding of large or small governments. They describe the ways in which surveillance becomes a growing reality over time describing, 
            <blockquote>

            "By focusing on surveillance as something either manifestly
            not present or stably pervasive, we lose the sense of surveillance infrastructures as continually in the process of
            becoming, and doing so in complex technological and
            social environments" (7).
                 

            </blockquote>


            Many of the examples referenced in this project are at some stage of completion. While some are currently in use across large populations, others are still in testing or have entirely been suspended indefinitely. In Singapore, the technology being used to track citizens is constantly evolving, and even as of researching for this project, information about what systems were or were not currently in use was difficult to confirm.
