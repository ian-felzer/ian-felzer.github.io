                <p> In 2017 Sidewalk Labs, a subsidary company owned by Google announced a deal with the city of Toronto to develop 12 acres of waterfront property into a technologically advanced model for its city of the future. The plan had the potential to encorporate its plans across over 800 acres of land in Toronto's Port Lands. Sidewalk Labs worked with Waterfront Tornto, a city agency to plan, design, and coordinate the project which was projected to cost over $1 Billion funded almost entirely by the Google Subsidiary itself (Hawkins). <br> The project was planned in phases, with each phase allowing for the company to move its footprint deeper into the Toronto Metro area, including in the neighboring area of Quayside. Among the benefits that Sidewalk Labs sought to receive in exchange for completing this technological project would be a share of the property taxes and development fees associated with this land, as well as the oppurtinity to obtain more valuable land in the process(“Google’s Sidewalk Labs Plans Massive Expansion to Waterfront Vision | The Star”).<br> </p>

                <p> Among the technological systems that Sidewalk Labs sought to install in the city included sensors to monitor vehicle and pedestrians to improve crosswalk safety, heated pavements, public wifi, advanced power grids, and many other sensor based technologies, that although were promised to collect only anonymized data or personally identifiable information (PII) with the approval of the owner, concerns about data collection, management, and sharing were among the reasons why the project was ultimately abandoned in May of 2020.  </p>

                <p>This project displayed the limits of local government institutions, and caused many local Canadians to develop distrust in the systems of government that allowed the project to move forward with limited oversight and protections.</p>

                <p> As a subsidiary of one of the world's largest and most technologically advanced companies, Sidewalk Labs was able to convince members of the Toronto government, both through data and likely through promised revenue, that using advanced sensors and artifical intelligence in almost every aspect of urban life from parking management, to power meters to waste management and everything in between. Although many promises were made by the company, including to make cities more affordable, safer,and innovative, while having the convenient byproduct of producing endless amounts of data about how people travel, live, communicate, and interact with their surroundings. </p>

                <h3 class="header"> Ethics of Project</h3>


                <p>Technology ethicist and researcher Bianca Wylie covered this project across many of its stages and through her work she in part described Sidewalk Lab's goal as to increase its power and to act as in effect a fourth arm of the Canadian government in its aim of expanding its reach as far as possible in the public works sector.<br> While the public received some oppurtunity to voice their concerns about the project, much of the information provided by Sidewalk Labs and the Canadian government was simply marketing materials meant to display the positive aims of the project, rather than details about how it planned to use, collect, and safeguard public data. <br> <br> As Wylie expained,since Waterfront Toronto, the real estate company co-leading this project was not beholden to Canadian freedom of information legislation, most of the negotiations for this project took place, and remained behind closed doors despite the strong impact on the public that any decisions would hold (Wiley, 2020) When seeking out potential companies to take on this public works initative, Waterfront Tornto asked the respondents to create both the technological systems that would power the new city, and the government and legal frameworks that would govern the use, colletion, and reporting requirements for data collection and finances (Wylie, 2020). As Wylie states, "Part of what made Sidewalk Toronto so problematic, from a governance perspective, was the power it threatened to hand over to Sidewalk Labs to lay out the infrastructure design of a large swathe of public and private space" Wylie,2020). This is the issue at the core of this project. <br><br> While Sidewalk Labs created a plan to use a Data Trust to manage urban data and create a transparent process for approvng the use or collection of data, as researchers form the University of Tornto describe, data trusts are not legal systems but rather a construct used to refer to any system in which data is handled with trust, and not legally bound by any specific terms. Thee researchers concluded that this project in particular presented conflicting models for how data would be managed, by both promising that data would be de-identified by default, but that it would also be publicly accessible, which goes against the idea of public ownership of data, rather than corporate control of it (Austin, 2021). Among the other problems with its data usage included the fact that since the proposed data trust would be a non-profit corporation, it would not be subject to Canada's federal private sector data protection laws or proincial public sector data laws, and thereby largely avoiding legal oversight (Austin, 2021). </p>

                <p>Ultimately what brought the project to its ultimate demise was a combination of public pressure and incomplete planning that the people and government of Toronto ultimately decided not to move forward with. While Sidewalk Labs as a company still exists and produces technology for cities, it has not acheived its goal of obtaining hundreds of acres of public land for use as a digital model for its ideal future society. This project shows what happens when governments allow companies to experiment with new technologies on a scale that impacts hundreds of thousands or even millions of people without regulation or significant oversight. While some of the plans in this project may have signifcantly improved the quality of life for citizens of the area, when presented with list of hundreds of unique and technologically complex features, citizens should not be expected to determine for themselves what risks each poses to their personal and digital safety, and which are violations of their privacy or rights under Canadian law. <br> <br> As part of this project Sidewalk Labs would have become a quasi public agency with potentially infinite amounts of information on the lives of private citizens. While the potential for technology to be used in beneficial ways such as to make streets safer and to reduce energy costs is a valuable prospect to consider, as Wylie states, turning over this much power to a private company who is given largely free reign to construct the city as they wish, is a dangerous and irreversable decision that can cost people their privacy and create even greater monopolies of scale (Wylie). </p> <br><br>

                <p> A study from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace found that 56 of 176 countries involved in creating new 'smart cities' actively use artificial intelligence for surveillance purposes as part of smart city or “safe city” initiatives (Wilkinson). While Sidewalk Labs promised to de-inidentify or otherwise protect the anonymity and privacy of data,high level data about how people use and interact with their surroundings and environment such as in the case of Sidewalk Lab's plans to make street safer using sensors and real time environmental monitors can still be used both financially and technologically to build and sell future technologies built using data obtained through users who were unaware of the data being collected or how it would be used. </p>

                <h3 class="header"><a href="#estonia">Estonia</a></h3>

                <p> Estonia, starting in 2001 sought to revolutionize its country and create one of the most technologically advanced national government systems anywhere in the world. E-governance is defined as a way to improve the function of government through the use of online services or systems that allow for information to be exchaned in secure and simplified ways (Jahankhani et al.). E-government, including that designed by Estonia seeks to connect businesses, government, citizens, and employees through the uses of standard Web 2.0 platforms such as digital interfaces and server based communication, and as of more recently, Web 3.0 technologies such as Blockchain technologies. Prior to the implementation of their digital system of governance, around 70% of the Estonian population had never used the internet, and many had limited access to computers and a internet connection (Jahankhani et al.). In 2002 Estonia launched a electronic identification card which becmae mandatory for all citizens, which contains a electronic chip which can be read by any card reader or at a government kiosk. Estonia has also expanded its e-government feature to visitors, creating a electronic residency program that allows visitors to use Estonian public and private services such as business regisration, banking services, and goods trading (Jahankani et al.). Estonia's goal is to have over 10 million e-residents by 2025, which is roughly 8 times its current population as of writing.<br> On top of these digital services for residents and corporations, Estonia created the X-Road, a Data Exchance Layer (DXL) that allows data to be safely exchanged between compputer systems in both public and private institutions. This layer sits in between the digital identification and public access applications available to residents, and uses a system built off of blockchain technology to handle client authentication, data entry, secure data exchange, logging and monitoring. This technology has been expanded to several other countries including Finland, Namiia, Iceland and Ukraine (Jahankani et al). The final layer, the application layer, handles services for citizens such as e-business registry, acess to police system, internet voting, education, social services, and healthcare access (e-estonia). These systems are also being used to expand digital activities inside of Estonia including by connecting autonomous vehicles, freight transport, and other systems to this digital platform in order to increase the speed of border entres and transit within the country (e-estonia)  </p>

                <h3 class="header">Ethics</h3>

                <p>This system uses a early implementation of blockchain technology to remove the need for a trusted third-party in the digital sustem. Estonia has been expanding this technology over many years, and has turned its country from a less technologically knowledgable one, into one that offers many of its government services solely or largely on internet platforms. While a blockchain based system provides more security for the trasfer and monitering of data access, this system relies on critical trust between the government and the population, and the population must be able to have full access and knowledge as to the whereabouts of their data and personally identifiable information. As one of the first nations to attempt a digitial transormation, Estonia has had to learn how to appropriately respond to cyber attacks that could cripple its digital infrastructure, something that Havard researcher Wolfgang Drechsler states makes the country both a beta tester for this new technology and a country that often experiences external hype driven by those who view the future as being technology driven and motivated (Drechsler). <br> While having digital services available to a population has many time and cost saving benefits, it makes it more difficult for outsiders and citizens to monitor the government's actions, and as we have seen with other uses of Blockchain technologies, it can ultimately be used to hide digital transactions or to gain entry into digital data systems. <br> <br> While blockchain is potentially a technology that can be valuable in imporving accountablility, as Professor and President of The Australian Association for Professional & Applied Ethics Simon Longstaff, describes, "The greater problem arises in conditions of asymmetry of power (bargaining power, information, kinetic force, etc.) – where blockchain might enable ‘transactions’ that are the product of force, fear and fraud" (Longstaff). This quote, although not directly associated with the E-Estonia project, displays the problem with any technology when used across a diverse population with varied levels of trust or experience with technology. </p>
