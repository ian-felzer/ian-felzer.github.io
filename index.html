            <p>Technology is a growing part of our everyday lives. From applications on our phones to the digitization of many of our daily functions, it is impossible to avoid the impacts, both positive and negative that this increase in technology creates. Over the past decades both science fiction and reality have imagined a future in which technology is onmipresent in our cities. From transportation to communication and governance, it has been imagined and planned that technology will bring forth a new future in which life is simpler, more convienent, and requires less human activity to maintain and manage. Over the past few years especially we have seen the unstoppable growth of technology companies around the world, which has allowed them to gain power and capital that has rarely been seen before in human history. This power among other things requires that companies maintain and expand the status quo, both by limiting competitors and by working closely with governments to make sure that they have the tools and support needed to maintain their power.

            <p> Smart city projects are being researched and developed in cities around the world including in Estonia, Montreal, Amsterdam, Barcelona, and even New York City. A smart city is described as method of using information and communication technologies to address needs or problems in urban areas (Thales). IBM first used the term in 2008, as it first sought to install 'smart' technologies within a city (Mark and Anya). Other major smart city projects have been developed by companies such as General Electric in Abu Dhabi, Paredes in Portugal developed by Microsoft, and Songdo in South Korea developed by Cisco. In a survey of over 125 different pieces of smart city literature published, it was found that artificial intelligence was the most referenced feature, with companies using it to stress the futuristic and high-tech components of the project (Mark and Anya). Smart cities can include things such as policies to improve environmental conditions, added technological infrastructure to measure,track, and minimize things such as energy usage, and to improve overall quality of life for residents and businesses.
                Each city is approaching common problems and challenges differently, with some focusing on implementing new technology in as many parts of urban life as possible, while others are focusing on making cities and governments work better for the people, with technology playing a large part in that effort. As Susan Leigh Star describes in her article entitled “The Ethnography of Infrastructure”, <blockquote> “People commonly envision infrastructure as a system of substrates-railroad lines, pipes and plumbing, electrical power plants, and wires. It is by definition invisible, part of the background for other kinds of work” (380).</blockquote><br> As Star describes, infrastructure is not just the physical elements that make up our urban world, but also the systems and connections between people and society that are often invisible, until they become broken and force change to be considered. These systems are closely linked to politics, sociocultural systems, and economics, and reflect the histories and themes that have guided our modern building of cities of scale. That is why it is both essential to understand the histories of the infrastructure that we take part in each day, and to understand who benefits from the current system and who is harmed by it. The systems that are examined in this project reflect a future in which it is both expected and mandatory for citizens to be part of a digital society, along with our physical society. For this technology to work, citizens must have phones,computers, or other devices, or risk being shut out from the government services and support that many rely on globally. Citizens must also accept the reality that they are all part of a large test study in which data is being collected about how they use government services, how they interact with the world, and how they live their lives. While this data may be anonymous or non-personal, it is still data that reflects how we live our lives, and is therefore inherently as personal as data can be. The study of STS focuses on how humanity interacts with science, culture, and technology, and how these topics interact on a daily basis. The study of infrastructure I beleive best encompasses the work of STS, because it studies how we interact with the world, and how the systems built into our society respond to the needs and goals of populations. <br><br> While the sociocultural and economic damage done by Robert Moses as described by Star was the result of his architectural projects that limited who could access parts of New York City, these new technologies similarly limit who can access and take advantage of the benefits of modern society. All of these projects similarly prohibit certain people from taking part in society by requiring technology to perform even basic government functions, and by designing infrastrastructure such as roads and public spaces in a way that certain groups of people are unable or uncomfortable using them. While some people may have no problem existing in a society full of sensors, camera technology, and digitally connected devices, many people do not see the need for the use of technology in these areas, and may be less likely to feel safe or comfortable in their communities because of it. I designed this project to be a brief overview of some of the projects that have taken place over the past few years, and are either ongoing or in some stage of finality. While these are far from the only projects, I beleive that these provide a strong overview as to the technologies we will continue to see presented and implemented in cities and countries around the world.

                <h3 class="header">Google Sidewalk Labs Toronto</h3>

                <p> In 2017 Sidewalk Labs, a subsidary company owned by Google announced a deal with the city of Toronto to develop 12 acres of waterfront property into a technologically advanced model for its city of the future. The plan had the potential to encorporate its ideas across over 800 acres of land in Toronto's Port Lands ("The Verge"). The project was pitched as a digital utopia, one in which society would be improved exponentially by the use of technology in every aspect of life, including in transportation, energy and resource management, housing, and management of public spaces. While it may have been a utopia for those building the techology and collecting the data, many citizens and politicians did not feel the same way. Quayside, the original neighborhood designated in the plan was described by the company as "the world's first neighborhood built from the internet up" (Bliss). It was created and marketed by Sidewalk Labs, who along with Waterfront Toronto, a city agency, worked to plan, design, and coordinate the project which was projected to cost over $1 Billion funded almost entirely by the Google subsidiary itself (Hawkins). <br> The project was planned in phases, with each phase allowing for the company to move its footprint deeper into the Toronto Metro area, starting in the  area of Quayside. Among the benefits that Sidewalk Labs sought to receive in exchange for completing this technological project would be a share of the property taxes and development fees associated with this land, as well as the oppurtinity to obtain more valuable land in the process(“Google’s Sidewalk Labs Plans Massive Expansion to Waterfront Vision | The Star”). <br>
                    The plans were designed with the intention of creating a “digital layer” that would represent the many moving parts of the city including by measuring and mapping things such as pedestrian traffic and energy use.Sidewalk Labs would make money off of multiple revenue streams including real estate, technology development, advisory services, administration of technology systems, and through performance payments agreed to by the city on project completion and at key project checkpoints (“Sidewalk Labs”). By creating technological solutions with significant sensor systems built in, Sidewalk Labs planned to create a system that only they could fix or upgrade, something that would garner them more money in the future. Sensors planned to be installed in the city included those meant to monitor odors, vibrations, and noise from both residential and business areas.  As policy analyst and journalist Bianca Wylie describes,<blockquote>“Smart cities are largely an invention of the private sector- an effort to create a market within government” (Bliss).</blockquote> Among the questions raised by the project were those regarding profitability. Although Sidewalk Labs promised that 60% of the subsystems used would not create or use personally identifiable data, the company was met with criticism for not requiring data to be de-identified at the point of collection, but rather only encouraging it (Johnston). Sidewalk Labs had to maintain profitability, and many believed that the project would become profitable by using the data collected through the sensors embedded in the city. Sidewalk Labs may also have profited off of real estate deals within the city, but it is likely that the company would have sought additional profitability areas as well. As Wylie describes, there is a potential for the data collected by Sidewalk Labs to be resold back to the government, something that would be funded by taxpayers. While the company tried to emphasize the value of its urban development hardware over its software and data collection tools, many of the hardware features and urban development strategies it introduced already exist in different parts of the world, and therefore the public had a right to be skeptical about the true nature of this plan.

                <p> Among the technological systems that Sidewalk Labs sought to install in the city included sensors to monitor vehicle and pedestrians to improve crosswalk safety, heated pavements, public wifi, advanced power grids, and many other sensor based technologies, that although were promised to collect only anonymized data or personally identifiable information (PII) with the approval of the owner, concerns about data collection, management, and sharing were among the reasons why the project was ultimately abandoned in May of 2020. The proposed city also contained a logistics hub connected to a underground package delivery system that would reduce traffic and a anaerobic digestion facility that could convert organic food waste into biogas ('Sidewalk Labs'). Other features of this smart city included a more streamlined Mobility as a Service system that would enhance public transit and other forms of non-vehicular transportation,as well as systems to monitor energy, HVAC, and lighting in both residences and businesses across the city in order to monitor, predict and decrease overall energy consumption and waste ("Sidewalk Labs"). The city also included plans to make the city more accessible to self driving cars, something that could potentially be used in partnership with Google's other subsidiary specializing in self driving cars, Waymo. Further features included eValet services for managing parking, Geographic Information System (GIS) maps to monitor maintenance needs across the city, a method  for storing personal identity information across distruted networks, community engagement tools, and tools to allow low and medium income households to apply for housing (Sidewalk Labs).</p>

                <p>This project displayed the limits of local government institutions, and caused many local Canadians to develop distrust in the systems of government that allowed the project to move forward with limited oversight and protections.</p>

                    <p id="firstP1"> As a subsidiary of one of the world's largest and most technologically advanced companies, Sidewalk Labs was able to convince members of the Toronto government, both through data and likely through promised revenue, that using advanced sensors and artificial  intelligence in almost every aspect of urban life from parking management, to power meters to waste management and everything in between would create an ideal city of the future for residents and governments. </p>

                    Although many promises were made by the company, including to make cities more affordable, safer,and innovative, while having the convenient byproduct of producing endless amounts of data about how people travel, live, communicate, and interact with their surroundings, the public approval for the project never reached the heights that the company wished. It is one thing for a company to invest in public and low cost housing in major cities, but doing so to enable greater data collection and technological control is not based in ethics or the best interests of the population.</p>

                <h3 class="header"> Ethics of Project</h3>


                <p>Technology ethicist and researcher Bianca Wylie covered this project across many of its stages and through her work she in part described Sidewalk Lab's goal as to increase its power and to act as in effect a fourth arm of the Canadian government in its aim of expanding its reach as far as possible in the public works sector.<br> While the public received some opportunity to voice their concerns about the project, much of the information provided by Sidewalk Labs and the Canadian government was simply marketing materials meant to display the positive aims of the project, rather than details about how it planned to use, collect, and safeguard public data. <br> <br> As Wylie explains,since Waterfront Toronto, the real estate company co-leading this project was not beholden to Canadian freedom of information legislation, most of the negotiations for this project took place, and remained behind closed doors despite the strong impact on the public that any decisions would hold (Wiley, 2020). Former Ontario privacy commisioner Ann Cavoukian resigned in late 2018 after Sidewalk Labs revealed that while it would strip data of personal identifiers, it could not guarantee that other groups or private entities participating in the project would do the same ("CBC News"). To Cavoukian this was a issue of both extraneous data collection, and of lack of consent from the user at the point of data collection. When seeking out potential companies to take on this public works initiative, Waterfront Toronto asked the respondents to create both the technological systems that would power the new city, and the government and legal frameworks that would govern the use, collection, and reporting requirements for data collection and finances (Wylie, 2020). As Wylie states,<blockquote>"Part of what made Sidewalk Toronto so problematic, from a governance perspective, was the power it threatened to hand over to Sidewalk Labs to lay out the infrastructure design of a large swathe of public and private space" Wylie,2020). </blockquote> This is the issue at the core of this project. <br><br> While Sidewalk Labs created a plan to use a Data Trust to manage urban data and create a transparent process for approving the use or collection of data, as researchers form the University of Toronto describe, data trusts are not legal systems but rather a construct used to refer to any system in which data is handled with trust, and therefore are not legally bound by any specific terms. As these researchers describe, the Urban Data Trust used a "open data" model wherein urban data would be publicly accessible by default, which goes against the idea of a data protection law in which nobody would own or control the data, including corporations (Austin and Lie, “Data  Trusts  and  the  Governance  of  Smart Environments: Lessons  from  the  Failure  of Sidewalk Labs’ Urban Data Trust”). Among the other problems with its data usage included the fact that since the proposed data trust would be a non-profit corporation, it would not be subject to Canada's federal private sector data protection laws or provincial public sector data laws, and thereby largely avoiding legal oversight (Austin, 2021). As technology ethicist Bianca Wylie describes, <blockquote> “The technology and data governance frameworks that govern most cities were created prior to the internet era and aren’t designed to manage the emerging issues created by pervasive data collection and connected technology (“CIGI”). </blockquote> While Canada has one set of laws regarding data privacy, they are not built to address the desires of large technology companies to become urban developers with the power to track residents and urban life with sensors placed into every area of city life.
 </p>

                <p>Ultimately what brought the project to its ultimate demise was a combination of public pressure, financial challenges, and incomplete planning that motivated the company and the city not to move forward with the project. While Sidewalk Labs as a company still exists and produces technology for cities, it has not achieved its goal of obtaining hundreds of acres of public land for use as a digital model for its ideal future society. This project shows what happens when governments allow companies to experiment with new technologies on a scale that impacts hundreds of thousands or even millions of people without regulation or significant oversight. While some of the plans in this project may have significantly improved the quality of life for citizens of the area, when presented with list of hundreds of unique and technologically complex features, citizens should not be expected to determine for themselves what risks each poses to their personal and digital safety, and which are violations of their privacy or rights under Canadian law. <br> <br> As part of this project Sidewalk Labs would have become a quasi public agency with potentially infinite amounts of information on the lives of private citizens. While the potential for technology to be used in beneficial ways such as to make streets safer and to reduce energy costs is a valuable prospect to consider, as Wylie states, turning over this much power to a private company who is given largely free reign to construct the city as they wish, is a dangerous and irreversible decision that can cost people their privacy and create even greater monopolies of scale (Wylie). </p> <br><br>

                <p class="finalP"> A study from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace found that 56 of 176 countries involved in creating new 'smart cities' actively use artificial intelligence for surveillance purposes as part of smart city or “safe city” initiatives (Wilkinson). While Sidewalk Labs promised to de-identify or otherwise protect the anonymity and privacy of data,high level data about how people use and interact with their surroundings and environment such as in the case of Sidewalk Lab's plans, can still be valuable tools for companies to use in research and development of future products. This would mean potentially profiting off of systems built using data obtained from unknowing residents. </p>

                <h3 id="header">Barcelona</h3>
                <p>When Ada Colau became mayor of Barcelona in 2015 she called for both governmental transparency and a greater democratic goernment. The new government created a new digital participatory platform, Decidim (“We Decide”, in Catalan) (“Barcelona Is Leading the Fightback against Smart City Surveillance”). This platform allowed citizens to submit proposals directly from citizens, and allowed for a more streamlined form of democracy that gave the voices of citizens more power. Citizens can debate issues direclty on the platform, and vote when the time comes to make a decision on the issue. The previous Barcelona government had used the data of citizens extensively, both to develop services and products for sale, and to make the city operate more efficiently. The new government decided that it would make data both more useful and more protected in part by incorporating data privacy into contracts with tech companies. Francesca Bria, the chief technology officer for Barcelona developed a plan to create a “New Deal” based on the rights-based, people centric framework which strongly disallows the exploitation of public or personal information in any way, but it especially disallows the profitization of it. While this system is not perfect, it is one example of how cities of the future must start now by creating strong policies that protect and limit the use of public data, and give citizens direct input into how their governments are run.<br> <br> Barcelona’s Digital Transformation Plan considers how technology should be used and applied across city functions, and consists of over twenty projects that emphasize open access, transparency and accountability.

                    <p class="finalP">Among the plans are a project to create a open source repository for systems such as their Decidim system, as well as systems to make the city’s budget open and accessible to everybody (“Barcelona’s Digital Government: Open, Agile and Participatory | IMI”). Other features include the Open Data BCN portal, a portal which contains over 450 data sets on things such as the population, health, economy, and education, and can be used and accessed by anybody.These, combined with strong frameworks designed to create strong digital rights for citizens and communities makes Barcelona one of the strongest examples of how e-democracy and e-governance can be applied effectively, fairly, and with a focus on privacy. The government of Barcelona has said that due to its laws, 70% of investments made by the government will be in open source software projects (“Barcelona’s Digital Government: Open, Agile and Participatory | IMI”).</p>

                <h3 class="header">Singapore</h3>

                <p> In 2014, Singapore launched the Smart Nation initiative in order to 'support better living, stronger communites, and create more oppurtunities for all" ("Singapore's Smart Nation Initiative- A Policy and Organizational Perspective"). The country has said that it is basing the platform off of Estonia's Digital identification system, which is expansive in terms of capabilities across both public and private sector organizations (Lago). Forming the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) the Government sought to bring in a new digital transformation of Singapore across the main areas of transport, urban living, business, health, digital government services, and strategic national projects. The government invested over $2.4 billion in fiscal year 2017 into technologies such as data analytics, sensors and related software that would allow for data to be shared between data centers and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors across Singapore ("Smart Nation and Digital Government Group, 2017"). The government has described its goals as to become "digital to the core", a goal that requires implemeting technological solutions across government and social services that require, and produce unimaginable amounts of valuable data about individuals and society. <br><br> In 2003 Singapore launched SingPass, or the Singapore Personal Access, a system used to connect Singapore residents to hundreds of e-services provided by over 60 government agencies. Among the promises made by the Government as to the benefits of this technology are its increased security provided by Two-Factor technology, which takes the form of either a one-time login pin, or more advanced features such as the newly launched facial recognition feature ("Singpass, 2020"). In 2018 the mobile app for SingPass was launched which allows user to access over 1,400 services across public and private sectors ("Digital Identity in Response to COVID-19"). Over 4 million Singapore residents currently use the app, and users often visit the app multiple times a month, making it a valuable tool for performing functions such as signing documents, authorizing transactions, and interacting with both business and government organizations ("Digital Identity in Response to COVID-19"). <br><br> When COVID-19 first became a problem in Singapore, the country launched TraceTogether, a platform designed for COVID-19 contact tracing and quarantine enforcement. Currently, over 80% of the Singaporian population uses the app, with the government mandating that residents  seeking to enter certain venues and events either use the mobile application or a physical fob that performs the same function (“In TraceTogether We Trust: Singapore’s Challenge with Data Governance and Ethics | Singapore Policy Journal”). The app works by using Bluetooth to determine if two users are in close proximity, and using encrypted user IDs to communicate with the users should one test positive for COVID-19 (Han). Fears have grown over this technology being using for increased surveillance, especially as other countries have increased COVID-19 lockdowns and surveillance in order to try to decrease case numbers.
 A second app, SafeEntry, was made to allow people to digitially check-in to public and private venues and to verify identity and contact tracing status.While the government promised that this data would only be used for contact tracing and in the case of severe criminal investigations, there were multiple points in the launch of this service in which the government failed to fully communicate who would be able to use or access the data (“In TraceTogether We Trust: Singapore’s Challenge with Data Governance and Ethics | Singapore Policy Journal”). The services were designed without transparency, and the government has failed to release full details about what data is collected, how it is stored, and what government functions have access to it. As one of the first countries to implement a national contact tracing solution, many faulted the government for not being more upfront about any and all potential use cases for the data. <br> </p>

                    <br><br> 

                    <p>  The Singapore Digital Government Blueprint outlines the government's hopes for a largely digitized government by 2023 ("Digital Government Blueprint"). Among the hopes for the plan is to provide users with a easy to use digital platform that will use artificial intelligence to provide personalized and anticipatory services to residents and business owners. The country has launched a number of systems in hopes of reaching this goal including OpenCerts, a blockchain based platform used to issue and validate academic certificates in order to prevent tampering or fraud ("Digital Government Blueprint"). The government has also began using robotics and other artificial intelligence based technologies to try to enhance safety, efficiency, and functionality, including through the creation of the Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP), a system used to coordinate and connect thousands of digital sensors that can feed into data platforms. As part of this plan the country aims to replace all 110,000 lamp posts in Singapore with wireless sensors that could allow for wireless beacons to be installed in each post that could guide electric vehicles or assist with road management and functionality (Bhunia).<br> <br> The plan also includes a strategy to develop a video analytics platform which could study traffic patterns, detect problems with roads, and would consist of feeds from public cameras installed along streets. It was found that over 2,400 law enforcement agencies in the United States alone use US based Clearview facial recognition  software, with at least 80 countries among those that have adopted similar Chinese surveillance and public security technology platforms since 2008 (Harjani). Without strong frameworks in place to monitor how the technology is used and stored, it is leading to a lack of trust among populations as this technology is implemented across their daily lives. <br><br> One form of this system being used is portable, and allows for a facial recognition camera to be set up within minutes. As people walk by, the features of their face are analyzed using biometric facial recognition technology, and matched against a database of faces (“HTX | Identifying a Face amongst Thousands at Our Borders”). The system searches a large database, and can detect changes in hairstyle, hair color, and facial hair (Harjani). This system, combined with others that the government is implementing are strong violations of any privacy or data protections that citizens should have.  Among the features that are being tested in these systems are facial recognition capabilities supported by the cameras mounted in the lamp posts, something that a Singaporian government spokesperson confirmed to Reuters in 2018 (Geddie).  
 
                    Each of these protections are scary on their own, but together they allow for the government to collect massive amounts of data about individuals and citizens, and use that data to conduct surveillance, criminal investigations, and in any other way as they choose. Some states in the US have begun to regulate facial recognition technology, but few countries have taken on the issue to the extent that it deserves and requires.</p>

                <h3 class="header">Ethics </h3>

                <p class="finalP">These platforms currently in use by Singapore, and those currently in testing or phased releases are worrying, and possess many similarities to technologies used in countries such as China to crack down on freedom of speech and government criticism (Dou). Yitu, a Chinese company claims that its facial recognition platform is capable of identifying over 1.9 billion faces in less than 3 seconds, something that would seemingly be easier to do in Singapore where the population is 5.68 million as of 2020 (Geddie). Singapore's SingPass presents a number of technological, social, and cultural issues that put the privacy and data of users at risk. Similar to the technology used in Estonia, many of the transactional services offered on the app are performed using cryptographic technologies, although details of the technology being used has not been revealed. In 2014, over 1,500 SingPass users had their accounts breached prior to the option of adding two factor authentication being created, although the extent to which the hackers gained access is unknown (Yu). Another hack in 2018 resulted in over a million residents having their personal information related to medical visits stolen (Cheok). In 2019 it was found that the Information Technology (IT) protocols in numerous Singapore government agencies were weak, including in the Defence Ministry and the Ministry of Finance. The problems found included weak measures to log any unauthorized users, and high levels of access that IT vendors had to information that they were not in a position to know (Yu). While every technological and analog system has its faults, storing and using unimaginable amounts of private user data in technological systems is rightfully scary and unpredictable, and governments have no responsibility to be transparent about how or when they use it. </p>

                <p> Estonia, starting in 2001 sought to revolutionize its country and create one of the most technologically advanced national government systems anywhere in the world. Using a three part system consisting of a digital identification system, a data exchange layer, and a application layer which allows different government and private servers to interact with the data exchange layer, the country has created a system in which common government tasks can be done entirely online (“Estonia X-Road Open Digital Ecosystem (ODE) Case Study”). Over 1,000 public and private organizations use the system, and its components are made to be reusable and to ensure privacy by design. Among the promises made by the government regarding the privacy of the system include that minimal data will be collected, that data will be collected no more than once when required, and that encryption and monitoring will be used to allow citizens to see when their data is accessed ("Estonia X-Road Case Study"). The system is designed so that the original owner of the data maintains the power to control who has access to it, something that cities such as Barcelona have attempted without the use of Blockchain technology. The exception to this rule is when a warrant is issued by a judge in order to gain access to a user's data. <br> <br> E-governance is defined as a way to improve the function of government through the use of online services or systems that allow for information to be exchanged in secure and simplified ways (Jahankhani et al.). E-government, including that designed by Estonia seeks to connect businesses, government, citizens, and employees through the uses of standard Web 2.0 platforms such as digital interfaces and server based communication, and as of more recently, Web 3.0 technologies such as Blockchain technologies. Prior to the implementation of their digital system of governance, around 70% of the Estonian population had never used the internet, and many had limited access to computers and a internet connection (Jahankhani et al.). In 2002 Estonia launched an electronic identification card which became mandatory for all citizens, which contains a electronic chip which can be read by any card reader or at a government kiosk. Estonia has also expanded its e-government feature to visitors, creating a electronic residency program that allows visitors to use Estonian public and private services such as business registration, banking services, and goods trading (Jahankani et al.). Estonia's goal is to have over 10 million e-residents by 2025, which is roughly 8 times its current population as of writing (Sullivan and Burger). It has also expanded the technology to allow for better connection between countries, in part by created e-residency collection centers in countries such as South Korea and Finland (Adeodato and Pournouri). This allows for better international connectivity, but increases the global risk should the technology be compromised.<br> <br>  </p>


                <div id="estonia2">
                    <p>On top of these digital services for residents and corporations, Estonia created the X-Road, a Data Exchange Layer (DXL) that allows data to be safely exchanged between computer systems in both public and private institutions. This layer sits in between the digital identification and public access applications available to residents, and uses a system built off of blockchain technology to handle client authentication, data entry, secure data exchange, logging and monitoring. This technology has been expanded to several other countries including Finland, Namibia, Iceland and Ukraine (Jahankani et al). The final layer, the application layer, handles services for citizens such as e-business registry, access to police system, internet voting, education, social services, and healthcare access (estonia.gov). <br> <br> These systems are also being used to expand digital activities inside of Estonia including by connecting autonomous vehicles, freight transport, and other systems to this digital platform in order to increase the speed of border entries and transit within the country (estonia.gov).

                <h3 class="header">Ethics</h3>

                <p>This system uses a early implementation of blockchain technology to remove the need for a trusted third-party in the digital system. Estonia has been expanding this technology over many years, and has turned its country from a less technologically knowledgeable one, into one that offers many of its government services solely or largely on internet platforms.  While a blockchain based system provides more security for the transfer and monitoring of data access, this system relies on critical trust between the government and the population, and the population must be able to have full access and knowledge as to the whereabouts of their data and personally identifiable information. As one of the first nations to attempt a digital transformation, Estonia has had to learn how to appropriately respond to cyber attacks that could cripple its digital infrastructure, something that Havard researcher Wolfgang Drechsler states makes the country both a beta tester for this new technology and a country that often experiences external hype driven by those who view the future as being made up of distributed networks such as Blockchain (Drechsler).<br> <br> The system has been criticized for being fragmented in its approach, with many different systems and subsystems involved in allowing servers and services to communicate effectively and securely. Over the history of its country, Estonia has faced many oppressive and suppressive regimes, which cause many in the international community to approach this new technology with more hesitation and more thorough analysis (Priisalu and Ottis). While the goals of this technology are to minimize inefficiencies of big government and to provide users with simple ways to access information and government services, the complicated technologies underpinning these systems rely on strong trust between the population, government, and individual system operators, something that cannot be guaranteed. Since the system is largely fragmented, it is up to each organization and party to maintain accurate registration and security measures (Paide et al.). This system has been described by some as being a safer alternative to systems such as the United States’ Social Security Number, as each Estonian ID number is protected by a physical or digital means of authenticating the user at each point of access into the system, and each transaction is recorded on the Digital Ledger Technology (DLT), its own form of the blockchain. While there might be more protections added by using a distributed ledger rather than a single, centralized database, cybersecurity is a major threat around the world and Estonia itself has faced numerous breaches that add extra pressure for the system to work as designed.
 <br> While having digital services available to a population has many time and cost saving benefits, it makes it more difficult for outsiders and citizens to monitor the government's actions, and as we have seen with other uses of Blockchain technologies, it can ultimately be used to hide digital transactions or to gain entry into digital data systems. <br> <br> While blockchain is potentially a technology that can be valuable in improving accountability, as Professor and President of The Australian Association for Professional & Applied Ethics Simon Longstaff, describes, <blockquote>"The greater problem arises in conditions of asymmetry of power (bargaining power, information, kinetic force, etc.) – where blockchain might enable ‘transactions’ that are the product of force, fear and fraud". (Longstaff)</blockquote> </p>
 
 <p> This quote, although not directly speaking about  the E-Estonia project, displays the problem with any technology when used across a diverse population with varied levels of trust or experience with technology. While blockchain technology may speed up everyday government processes, without strong and reliable systems in place prior to digitization, these online services are likely to fail or not live up to expectations. Many governments and private organizations see Estonia as a gold standard that should be replicated globally, which may be more difficult to do in countries with less trust between citizens and goverment, or in countries where invasions of privacy are the norm and not the exception. <br><br> Whenever a government is in charge of creating, managing, and assuring the success of a platform as broad and far reaching as this one, there are always ethical concerns present about who has access to the technology behind it, and what if any backdoors are present. As Wolfgang Drechsler describes, this system has also helped to legitimize the Estonian government, and has increased trust between the government and the population. It has also helped to make Estonia more of a global name, with this technology making it easier for foreign companies and citizens to operate and visit the country (Drechsler). While Drechsler argues that technology in itself does not create ethical goals or added trust within a population, Estonia is an ideal test case for the technology as it has few barriers both in how the government operates, and in the openness of the population to new ideas. </p>
<p class="finalP">In 2007 Estonia was hit with a major cyber attack in the form of a Distributed Denial of Service (D-DoS) attack that brought its internet down (Hague). While this attack did not compromise personal data, in the years since, the internet has only become a greater element guiding every aspect of the personal and professional life of Estonians. The Estonian government may promise that the security measures of their system are virtually impenetrable, blockchain technologies are relatively new, and therefore it is likely that there are security risks that have yet to be fully discovered.</p>

            <h3 class="header" id="">Ethical and STS Considerations</h3>

            <p>Langdon Winner in his essay "Do Artifacts Have Politics" describes the overt less overt impacts of technology on city design stating, <blockquote>"if 
                our moral and political language for evaluating technology includes only categories having to do with tools and uses, if it does not include attention to the 
                meaning of the designs and arrangements of our artifacts, then we will be 
                blinded to much that is intellectually and practically crucial" (125).</blockquote> 


                </p>

                <p>  While this quote focuses on the work of architect Robert Moses on the physical infrastructure that makes up New York City, the same principles and considerations must be adopted in our consideration of digital technologies. In search of technologies to make society more streamlined, we risk becoming comfortable with the tradeoff of privacy in exchange for reduced government bureaucracy, or allowing increased use of technology to systematically ignore or leave out those who do not have access to the needed technology. In some cases technology can be used as a intermediary  between government and the population, which can give the government a way to act with near impunity.</p>
            
           <br><br> 

           <p>   STS scholar Laura Forlano in her essay "Decentering the Human in the Design of Collaborative Cities" summarizes the issues with the technologies referenced in the above sections, stating in her essay </p>
        
         
            
            <blockquote>
                "Rather than being understood as political in themselves,
                decisions around these technological black boxes take place in
                bureaucratic black boxes: city agencies with endless acronyms and
                responsibility for technology and telecommunications issues (3)".</blockquote>

                <p>  In each of the examples, although especially in the example of Google's Sidewalk Lab, the government may have approved the project, but the public was left largely without any useful information from which to guide their opinions, and they had few options to fight back against the efforts of the government even if they wished. Without fully understanding the technology, residents were given seemingly two options, take part in this new technological testbed, or leave. As Paul Dourish and Genevieve Bell discuss in their article "Resistance is futile: Reading Science Fiction Alongside Ubiquitous Computing", among the questions raised by science fiction television shows are those regarding surveillance, both by state sponsored actors and private companies doing the bidding of large or small governments. They describe the ways in which surveillance becomes a growing reality over time describing, </p>


            
          
            <blockquote>

            "By focusing on surveillance as something either manifestly
            not present or stably pervasive, we lose the sense of surveillance infrastructures as continually in the process of
            becoming, and doing so in complex technological and
            social environments" (7).


                 

            </blockquote>

            </p>

            <p>
                Many of the examples referenced in this project are at some stage of completion. While some are currently in use across large populations, others are still in testing or have been suspended indefinitely. In Singapore, the technology being used to track citizens is constantly evolving, and even as of researching for this project, information about what systems were or were not currently in use was difficult to obtain and confirm. As Dourish and Bell describe, surveillance is not all or nothing. It often evolves in slow iterations that are meant to make citizens more comfortable with the idea of personal data being used across government functions, and are often done in the name of research and development of technologies that are said to have the potential to improve quality of life and to make positive impacts on society.While Singapore’s Smart Lightposts may in fact decrease auto accidents or help make streets safer, they may also be used as facial recognition tools in pursuit of a more powerful police state. Each and every technology has multiple potential uses, and often what is presented to the public is simply the one that has less fear or stigma associated with it. </p>




            <h3 class="header">Techno-Politics and the City</h3>

            <p>Dr. Anique Hommels, Science and Technology Studies Professor at  Maastricht University in the Netherlands describes techno-politics as 
                <blockquote>‘the combination of physical artifacts or other man-made objects that exist within the geo-political borders of the city and are constituted through arrangements of power and authority that embody, or enact political goals’ (Foley et al., 2020)</blockquote>
                </p>

               <br><br>

              <p>
                
               This argument supports the idea that similar to how Langdon Winner describes, society, infrastructure, and politics are deeply connected, and one does not function without the other. As Hommels describes, smart city projects are socio-technical in nature, and how deep economic, social, and political motivations that impact how projects succeed or fail. While Hommels argues that STS scholars may not be best suited for research into smart city implementations, she ultimately concludes that research and analysis must be done in terms of both ethnography, and in a critical nature of any proposed technologies (Hommels). Research must also be done into the impacts of smart city technologies on citizens of varying socioeconomic statuses, in order to make sure that the loudest voices are not the only ones heard. As Mark and Anya describe, there are also significant conflicts of interest within smart city projects. For example, IBM maintains a Smart City Index to rank smart city development projects, while working on its own smart city projects such as in Jakarta (IBM).</p></p>

            <h3 class="header">Systematic Decisionmaking at Scale</h3>


            <p>Ranjit Singh and Steven Jackson in their article “Seeing Like an Infrastructure”, describe the Aadhaar system used in India that similarly identifies residents and citizens in order to grant access to government services, systems, and the wider society as a whole. Among the problems with the system as Singh and Jackson describe are its practice of excluding those who do not fit into distinct categories as set by the government, and similarly, denying access to those who fit into certain social, cultural, or economic categories (Singh and Jackson). They describe this process stating, <blockquote> “Residual categories produce varying forms of
                marginalization as people most in need of visibility find it hardest to secure” (Singh and Jackson, 315). </blockquote> <br><br> 
                
                <p> As Singh and Jackson explain, infrastructure is not useful when data and systems are not accessible to those who need it most, including those who may not have access or understanding of the newest technologies. In Estonia, while prior to the introduction of the X-Road system a large percentage of the population did not have access to mobile phones, the percentage has consistently grown over the years since 1997 which has given a majority of the population access to these services (Bolin).<br> <br> As the authors detail, marginalization does not occur solely in one form, but it instead can take many forms including through identification systems, transportation, and even access to basic necessities. Aadhaar, similar to systems in Singapore, used a biometrics based identification system in order to allow for lower class families to access welfare services and identification. By using a digital ID and data system as a requirement to get access to civil services, it creates the potential for people to be systematically left out, incorrectly categorized, and for data to be used to simplify systems, often removing people from them as a result (Singh and Jackson).</p>
            
            <br> <br> </p>
                
               <p> During a pilot test for Aadhaar  in 2015, it was found that fingerprints for the majority of beneficiaries did not match authentication in one of the districts (Singh and Jackson). Each time a beneficiary failed a screening, it risked placing them into a data category of “duplicate” or “beneficiaries who have forsaken their entitlements”, which could cause somebody to lose their benefits due to an error entirely unrelated to any of their own actions. In 2016 it was reported that 24.8% of  Public Distribution System (PDS) families had not received payments necessary for them to obtain food due to problems with the Aadhaar numbers (Singh and Jackson). The number was found to have remained consistent through 2017, both due to errors in technology and in lack of public education about the new system. While countries examined in this project have attempted to solve problems of access through a variety of means including by using mobile applications and distributed networks, issues of access, fairness, and accountability will always be present and built into systems. <br> <br> While Singapore has access to large amounts of data on its population, when using data analytics on a large scale data must be flattened or simplified to some extent, which risks targeting or leaving out minority or at risk populations in the process. Each example uses surveillance in a different way.
                </p>


                <h3 class="header">Comparison of Surveillance Tactics</h3>

                <p>
                    Each of these projects uses surveillance and surveillance technologies in different ways and each exhibits different levels of transparency or the lack thereof. Sidewalk Labs promised that its data would be de-identified at the source and that most of the data collected would be focused on high level analysis of energy use, transportation efficiencies, and other trend focused data that could help improve systems over the short and long term. While this form of data collection alone may not damage one’s personal freedom, fears over Sidewalk Labs’ transparency and honesty call into question their promises regarding data collection and usage.  Estonia has promised that its system is one of, if not the safest digital government system since it is entirely decentralized, and users have full access to logs that show who accessed and viewed their data. Regardless of the technology being used to store and access this data, it is still highly personal information being collected and stored by different government agencies, something that could lead to privacy violations if the technology were to fail or if one agency were to implement it incorrectly. The examples presented from Singapore represent the greatest threat to information security and privacy. The country has made it a priority to expand digital access to government services, while collecting and sharing information in opaque ways. Their implementation of sensor based surveillance has the potential to lead to major privacy violations such as those we have seen in China, and can in effect create a 24/7 CCTV system showing the position of all Singaporian citizens outside of their homes. While Singapore has not released the details of this program or who would produce the hardware or software, it is likely one of many private companies that provides this technology to other countries such as China or Russia. Using COVID-19 as one reason for the increased tracking of citizens, Singapore has created and released technologies that are likely to remain permanent even after the risks from the pandemic have passed. This will likely be framed as a decision to prevent COVID-19 from reemerging as a threat, but the technologies will continue to be used for purposes of government oversight, or for matters of policing. I think that overall this presents the biggest threat to the population, and as a report from the Brookings Institute points out, <blockquote> "These effects, however, are not mutually exclusive: improved surveillance may enhance public safety in general while also contributing to targeted repression of political opposition or other marginalized groups" (Greitens). </blockquote> </p>
                    

                    <p>
                    
                    As this research describes, China has led international efforts to expand the use of Chinese technologies for the purposes of ‘public safety’, even going so far as to providing loans to countries to obtain and deploy this technology (Greitens). Regardless of who is funding this technology, many countries are seeking to use this technology to promise safer and less crime ridden communities, a promise that cannot yet be backed up with empirical evidence, in part due to the lack of trust that these overly authoritarian governments possess on the world stage.It is too difficult, if not impossible to balance the positives of this technology, which include its potential for reducing crime or making it easier to catch criminals, with the negatives of this technology which include severe breaches of privacy, misidentification of those in minority communities, and integrated biases that make the system functionally repressive. While the United States has banned the use of certain Chinese technologies such as those made by Huawei, many US law enforcement agencies use some form of facial recognition which are equally opaque in functionality and accuracy. As the Brookings Institute points out, if the United States chooses not to create strong human rights based regulation on this technology quickly, other countries such as China will be able to shape and define it how they wish, and expand it globally without any protections in place to assure human rights and privacy protections.
                    While the system in Barcelona does not incorporate surveillance in any meaningful way, the digital systems have the potential to collect and store data on the decisions of everyday citizens and if leaked, could violate somebody’s right to private opinions and political votes.

            <h2 class="header">The Future and Final Prediction</h2>

            <p>Data collected in 2019 showed that there were 379 deployed smart city projects in 61 countries, with the market growing quickly as technology becomes more accessible and less cost prohibitive (“CSIS”). In our current pandemic era state, many believe that cities will never return to a pre-pandemic “normal”, and require significant policy, urban development, and technological changes in order to attract more tourists, businesses, and residents. The pandemic only increased the use of technology across cities, with many US and global cities using digital services to provide and target COVID-19 services to those who needed it. For example Chicago used anonymized cell phone data in order to determine what percentage of the population was staying home during quarantine, and many other cities used large datasets to inform decision making about quarantines, employer policies, and other COVID-19 safety measures (“Lessons from the Pandemic: The Future of ‘Smart Cities’ | Center for Strategic and International Studies”). <br> <br> Many countries have faced economic challenges due to COVID-19 that have temporarily put on hold large projects such as smart technologies, but many are using the opportunity to conduct more research and testing on potential data and e-governance projects. Companies such as Google, Toyota, and Microsoft are aiming to be at the forefront of these new projects, and continue to produce broad and futuristic plans for the city of the future as they see it. Futuristic and technologically innovative cities have been imagined in places such as Cancun, Japan, Shenzhen, Finland, Saudi Arabia, and many others, with each project appearing to be more science fiction-esque than the next.   </p>
                <br><br>

                <p> In Nevada, millionaire Jeffrey Berns has developed plans to build a 67,000 acre independent township in Storey County Nevada that would operate entirely on blockchain technology (Nevett). The governor of the state has allowed the project and others like it to move forward, something that opens the door for more communities that operate solely on a shared set of technological ideals and perspectives. No matter how you feel about technologies such as blockchain and Bitcoin, Professor at Harvard University and author of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism Shoshana Zuboff describes the issue with this stating,</p>

                <blockquote> "Blockchain technology is a substitute for contracts. It's a substitute for social trust" </blockquote> 

              
                
                <p>This quote demonstrates that although blockchain may be a useful technology in a general sense, abandoning all norms and economic systems that we currently operate on creates a isolated population that is not held to the same standards or governmental policies as everybody else. As Kevin Baker describes in “Model Metropolis”, creating isolated areas of high economic activity also has the negative effect of making all other areas less desirable for employers and citizens, and can lead to overcrowding and underemployment (Baker).</p>


                <p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) describes facial recognition as one of “the most dangerous of the many new technologies available to law enforcement” (ACLU). Technology researchers Timnit Gebru and Joy Buolamwini concluded in 2018 research that certain facial analysis algorithms misclassified Black women 35% of the time, with significantly lower error rates for white men (“How Is Face Recognition Surveillance Technology Racist? | News Commentary | American Civil Liberties Union”). Subsequent studies confirmed that these issues exist in other software included some designed by Amazon. The ACLU cites a US government report that confirms that facial recognition works best on white, middle aged male subjects, and works least well on people of color and women (ibid.). Singapore’s use of facial recognition goes beyond what we currently have in place in the United States, although we have yet to see any potential public data released about its successes and failures, and we may never see true data on its impacts. Authors Chris Gilliard and David Golumbia describe the impacts of mass surveillance in their article “Luxury Surveillance” stating, <blockquote> “ In general terms, consumers of luxury surveillance see themselves as powerful and sovereign, and perhaps even immune from unwelcome monitoring and control. They see self-quantification and tracking not as disciplinary or coercive, but as a kind of care or empowerment” (Gilliard and Golumbia) </blockquote>  </p>



                    
                    <p> This quote describes common data collection devices that people commonly wear such as Apple Watches and Fitbits, but I believe that it extends similarly to the idea of the smart city. Many people see the smart city as a futuristic improvement to our current life that warrants some loss of privacy. Many are willing to sacrifice personal privacy for things such as Face ID unlocking on the iPhone, and for social networks such as Facebook in order to interact with people more easily. It is for these reasons that the technologies referenced in this assignment are not entirely popular or unpopular. Each person is satisfied with different levels of privacy, and technologies that may seem overly authoritarian to many of us may be entirely acceptable to other people if it means that they can save time in an airport or travel more seamlessly. While Sidewalk Labs faced many local opponents to their project, many saw it as an opportunity to build a data rich community that would be more environmentally friendly and more reflective of cities of the future. As with many examples, it is impossible to know how a technology will function until it is implemented, but as Gebru and Buolamwini show, the true impacts of a technology are often not made public until citizens find out for themselves what the true flaws in the system are. STS provides a strong lens from which to analyze this technology with, although many of these projects are sustained by private interests and funding from large governments and organizations, which makes it all the more likely that we will continue to see new technologies released and tested all around the world.<br> <br> As Julian Bleecker points out in Design Fiction, while we all have iPhones constantly on our person, we often forget about the privacy that we give up, including our personal habits, vocal recordings, facial images, and many other types of information that are impossible to retrieve once released. While under our current laws this data is obtained legally with our partial consent at the time of purchase of the device, we have to build a sustainable and private future by enacting laws and policies that restrict the amount of data that can be collected by governments and private companies, and protects our right to privacy and consent. As Langdon Winner describes, “Consciously or not, deliberately or inadvertently, societies choose structures for technologies that influence how people are going to work, communicate, travel, consume, and so forth over a very long time” (Winner, 127). Every design choice that is made has the potential to have major impacts in the short and long term health of a community, and that is why the community must be heavily involved in all parts of the design and development process. Lack of regulation of the technology industry and the massive growth of ‘smart’ devices with computer chips inside of them has led to major technological companies becoming ultra powerful and influential in their own right. As these companies seek to expand into new markets, urban technology is a clear next step, since their technology is already in the hands of everyday citizens. It is for this reason that governments, non-profit organizations, grassroots organizations, and private companies must come together to defend the basic right to privacy that we all should be entitled to, and work to make sure equity, privacy, and data protection are all integrated into any new technologies that are proposed, designed or implemented.</p>
